\begin{description}

\item[AXA Insurance | Personal Lines:] \hspace{1mm} \\
\textbf{Data Science Manager} \emph{March 2020 -- Present}\\
\textbullet \quad Responsible for driving technological excellence, R\&D and development of tools and techniques as manager in pricing's data science team. Team also sources and maintains internal and external datasets. \\
\textbullet \quad Provided automations for compliance and QA review of ML interpretability packs for model refreshes. Implemented algorithms from literature review and created novel processes based on stakeholder requirements. \\
\textbullet \quad Designed process for geographic smoothing in non-linear model pipelines. Recommendations implemented as next motor risk model refresh with predictive improvement equivalent to previous full refreshes.\\
\textbullet \quad Maintained common code through R and Python packages. \\
\textbullet \quad Explored, load tested and benchmarked cloud-based scoring pipeline optimisations. This ensured Pricing model APIs could meet SLAs at volumes of up to 500 requests per second. Proof of Concept in advance of IT project for industrialised solution for ML Deployment.
\\\\
\textbf{Technical Pricing Manager} \emph{March 2019 -- Feb 2020}\\
\textbullet \quad Responsible for maintenance and improvement of AXA Direct Motor's risk pricing layer.\\
\textbullet \quad Led projects and analysis, and provided line management responsibilities across a team of four analysts.\\
\textbullet \quad Delivered first incremental refresh of machine learning risk models. New models deploy expect strong Loss Ratio benefit using innovative new features, collaborating with Data Science.\\
\textbullet \quad Peril Allocation research project found more predictive splits for injury claims.\\
\textbullet \quad Complete re-build of AvsE interactive reporting. Built tools to automatically flag and rank problematic n-way segments. Created plots with approximations for statistical significance.
\\\\
\textbf{Senior Technical Pricing Analyst} \emph{January 2018 -- February 2019}\\
\textbullet \quad Key member of team which delivered new ML model suite. Main overseer of data wrangling, rating system deployment, impact analysis and project retrospective. \\
\textbullet \quad Supported members of the team with technical problems and shared areas of knowledge I have gained from a large spectrum of pricing work. \\
\textbullet \quad Feature engineering from test-level MOT data, followed by analysis and presentation of statistically significant pricing deficiencies. \\
\textbullet \quad Developed a number of bespoke functions for in-house R packages. Included ML interpretability plots and dynamic html MI packs. These were instrumental in assuring stakeholders of the performance and validity of the new ML models. \\
\textbullet \quad Chaired regular meeting for cross-team analysts to present work and share knowledge. \\
\textbullet \quad End of year review rating of `Excellent'.
\\\\
\textbf{Technical Pricing Analyst} \emph{June 2015 -- December 2017}\\
\textbullet \quad Refreshed Motor Risk Pricing models in Emblem and wrote the code for SAS Data Prep, post-deploy analysis and monitoring. \\
\textbullet \quad Developed in-house alternative to market-leading geographic analysis tool in R. Incorporated several bespoke algorithms to compete/ensemble. Tool has been shared across business units, including overseas, with consistent improvement in performance on unseen data. \\
\textbullet \quad Examined claims development across rating factors and created bootstrap solution to assess significance of observed differences. \\
\textbullet \quad Re-wrote Motor Expected Loss Ratio (ELR) process. Integrated stochastic elements to produce confidence intervals on reported ELR to demonstrate to stakeholders variance of loss ratio predictions.\\
\textbullet \quad End of year review ratings of `Excellent' and `Outstanding'.
\\\\
\textbf{eRate} (Rating Engine) \textbf{Analyst} \emph{April 2014 -- June 2015}\\
\textbullet \quad Received award from MD for delivering Group Internal Audit action to design and implement automated solution for testing of aggregator value mappings against a tight deadline.\\
\textbullet \quad Devised several highly effective changes to weekly rating deploy processes - including digestible log of production rating models for stakeholders and Weekly Deploy Stand Up. \\
\textbullet \quad Proactively working with several areas of the business (such as pricing, commercial and IT teams) in order to deliver accurate and timely pricing changes, small change, defect fixes and projects.\\
\textbullet \quad End of year review rating of `Excellent'.

\section*{Skills}
\begin{description}
\item[Leadership and Communication] I enjoy working closely with others and \textbf{mentoring} junior colleagues. Helping them to understand complex issues and deliver quality work can be immensely rewarding. \\
I have often received strong feedback on my \textbf{presentation and communication} skills. I am comfortable adapting my content and style as appropriate; to update stakeholders, secure buy in for projects, or to elicit discussion and generate ideas.
I enjoyed the experience of running my own regular meeting for analysts, curating the agenda and modifying the format to give the most value to my colleagues.\\
My early career at AXA put me at the heart of many IT projects, introducing me to the benefits of \textbf{Agile project methodologies}. I adopt many of these into my own management  style - both in the projects I lead and the work stacks of my direct reports.
\item[Technical Knowledge] I am motivated by the challenge of designing elegant solutions to business problems. \\
I have a high level of proficiency in \textbf{R}, \textbf{Python} and \textbf{SAS}, I am experienced in \textbf{SQL} and \textbf{VBA} among others.\\
I have always looked to add to my technical skill set; whether that be Actuarial Exams, research projects or online courses on topics such as Java through Coursera and various through DataCamp and LinkedIn Learning.
\item[Innovation] Driving improvements to processes and models using novel ideas and methods, in order to deliver a competitive edge to the business is something I truly enjoy. 
I try to work in a way which \textbf{challenges and improves processes}, without sacrifices to objective outcomes.\\
Throughout my career at AXA I have made improvements to many processes across the eRate and Pricing team. I encourage my team to develop and share tools and processes that improve our ways of working and the communication of results to stakeholders.
