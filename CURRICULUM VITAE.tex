\section*{Skills}
\begin{description}

\item[Technical Knowledge] I am motivated by the challenge of designing elegant solutions to business problems. \\
I have a high level of proficiency in \textbf{R} and \textbf{SAS}, experienced in \textbf{VBA}, \textbf{SQL} and \textbf{Git}, amongst others.\\
I continuously look to add to my technical skill set, whether that be Actuarial Exams, research projects at work or coding courses in my own time. e.g. Data Camp (\textbf{Python}), Coursera (\textbf{Java})

\item[Leadership and Communication] I enjoy working closely with my team, \textbf{mentoring} them and other junior colleagues - helping them to understand and work on complex issues is very rewarding. \\
I have taken many of pieces of work to various committees for approval or discussion. I have often received positive feedback on my \textbf{presentation and communication} from attendees within and outside of pricing. I ran my own regular meeting, curating the agenda and modifying the format to give the most value to the analyst community.\\
My early career at AXA put me at the heart of many IT projects, introducing me to the benefits of \textbf{Agile project methodologies}. I adopt these into my management of large projects as well as analyst work stack.

\item[Innovation] Where appropriate I will look to complete projects and ad-hoc work in a way that \textbf{challenges and improves processes}, without sacrifices to objective outcomes.\\
Throughout my career at AXA I have made improvements to many processes across the eRate and Pricing team. For example writing and sharing R functions and SAS macros to cut analyst time spent on repetitive work and rewriting code. Results have improved run times, readability and accuracy.\\
I encourage my team to develop and share R tools and processes that improve our ways of working and communication of our results to stakeholders.
