\begin{description}

\item[Computer Literacy] I am highly proficient in SAS and `R'. Further to this I have experience in VBA, SQL, Python, Java and GIT version control. \\

\item[Leadership and Communication] I enjoy working closely with others, and mentoring more junior colleagues and helping them to understand and work on complex issues. My early career at AXA put me at the heart of many IT projects, introducing me to Agile project methodologies. I have taken many of pieces of work to various committees for approval or discussion and run my own fortnightly meeting, curating the agenda to give the most value to the attending analysts.

\item[Innovation] I am naturally quite assertive and will often take the initiative to push projects on as necessary, including finding innovative solutions to blockers. For example working on a project to try and find statistical significance in the difference in Chain-Ladder development curves of two groups which has no assumed distributions.
