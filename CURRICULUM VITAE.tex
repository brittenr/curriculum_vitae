\section*{Skills}
\begin{description}
\item[Leadership and Communication] I try to embed the best elements of \textbf{Agile} operating models in the way I work and manage the work around me.  Test \& Learn, focusing on the customer and constant communication are a few of the principles that I find most beneficial in getting the most value from an analytical function.\\
I enjoy \textbf{coaching} colleagues and I manage my relationships with emphases on engagement and empowerment.
%I find great satisfaction in communicating complex issues to engage stakeholders or to help others deliver high quality work.\\
I am comfortable adapting my \textbf{presentation and communication} style and content as appropriate; to update stakeholders, secure buy in and engagement, or to generate discussion and ideas. 
%This came together in my experience running my own regular meeting for analysts, curating the agenda and modifying the format to give the most value to my colleagues.
\item[Innovation] Driving improvements to processes and models using novel ideas and methods, in order to deliver a competitive edge to the business is something I truly enjoy. 
I try to work in a way which \textbf{challenges and improves processes} while maintaining focus on objective outcomes.\\
Throughout my career I have made improvements to many processes across multiple domains. I encourage my colleagues to develop and share processes that improve ways of working and the communication of results to stakeholders.
\item[Technical Knowledge] I am motivated by the challenge of designing elegant solutions to business problems.
I have a high level of proficiency in \textbf{R}, \textbf{Python} and \textbf{SQL} and I am experienced in \textbf{SAS} and \textbf{VBA} among others.\\
I always look to add to my technical skill set; whether that be learning from those around me, Actuarial Exams or continuous online learning
