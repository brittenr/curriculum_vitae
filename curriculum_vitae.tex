I enjoy \textbf{coaching} colleagues and I manage my relationships with emphasis on mutual trust and empowerment.
I am comfortable adapting the style and content of my \textbf{presentation and communication} as appropriate; to update stakeholders, drive engagement, secure buy-in, or to generate discussion and ideas. 
\item[Innovation] Driving improvements to processes and models using novel ideas and methods, in order to deliver a competitive edge to the business is something I truly enjoy. 
I try to work in a way which \textbf{challenges and improves processes} while maintaining focus on objective outcomes.\\
Throughout my career I have made improvements to many processes across multiple domains. I encourage my colleagues to develop and share knowledge and ideas to improve ways of working and the communication of results to stakeholders.
\item[Technical Knowledge] I am motivated by the challenge of designing elegant solutions to business problems.\\I possess the skills and knowledge to execute solutions whether they be implementations of MVP or seeking marginal improvements to existing products with modelling and coding excellence. I am adept at orchestrating the necessary work in small teams or large groups of disparate stakeholders.\\
I stay abreast of latest developments to technical best practice through understanding of the work of the teams around me and self study for ongoing personal development.\\
